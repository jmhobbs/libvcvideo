libvcvideo is intended to be a simple, cross platform video library targeting the
most amateur programmers and basic applications. The core targeted devices are
USB webcams, hopefully with capabilities expanding over time to include tuner
devices as well.

Currently the library is Linux compatible only, and only specific V4L1 devices.
Currently this is NOT a shared library, please link manually or wait a few more revisions.

libvcvideo is released under the GNU Public License v3.

-------------------------------[DEPENDENCIES]-----------------------------------

A modern kernel with V4L.
A video device.

This library would not exist without the wonderful documentation of V4L2

And the mediocre documentation of V4L :-)

I was also inspired through the use of OpenCV
