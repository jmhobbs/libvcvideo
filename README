libvcvideo is intended to be a simple, cross platform video library targeting the
most amateur programmers and basic applications. The core targeted devices are
USB webcams, hopefully with capabilities expanding over time to include tuner
devices as well.

Currently the library is linux compatible only.

libvcvideo is released under the GNU Public License v3.

To install or update the library, just run the install.sh script with root privileges.


-------------------------------[DEPENDENCIES]-----------------------------------

A modern kernel with v4l2.
