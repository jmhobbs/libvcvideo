Currently this is NOT a shared library, please link manually or wait a few more revisions.

You can build some test programs with:
make testPlain
make testGtk

Or you can just build the library with:
make lib/videoDevice.o

If you don't have libsigc++ installed, build without it:
SIGCPP='NO' make lib/videoDevice.o

If you don't have magick++ installed, your "testPlain" build will fail. Build with:
MAGICK='NO' make testPlain

If you want debug output (goes to cerr) build the library with:
VCDEBUG='YES' make lib/videoDevice.o

If you have doxygen and want to make your own copy of the API documentation, be in the
root of the project and run:
make docs
