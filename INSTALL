libvcvideo does not use autotools yet, so building is a bit different.

You can build and install the shared library and it's plugins with a simple "make install" as root.

Alternately you can build a static version with "make staticLib"

There are some example binaries in the "bins" directory, build them with
"make bins" or individually by name (without the .cpp).  Please be aware that
these are all statically linked. The sole exception is "make dynTest" which will
try to build a very simple dynamically linked test.

-------[BUILD OPTIONS]-------
If you don't have libsigc++ installed, or don't want to use it, build without it
by appending your make commands with " SIGCPP='NO' ", like so:

SIGCPP='NO' make staticLib

If you don't have magick++ installed, your binaries vill complain or fail. Build
with " MAGICK='NO' " to skip it.

If you want debug output (goes to cerr) build with " VCDEBUG='YES' "

-------[OTHER TARGETS]-------
If you have doxygen and want to make your own copy of the API documentation, go
to the root of the project and run "make docs"
